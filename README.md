This mess needs to be organized.  I also need to nail down these Makefiles
to scoot around having to use the Arduino development studio.

Ardiuno Hacks:

The LCD essentially takes up an entire Arduino, with a few pins to spare to
communicate events and such.

The examples provided by OSEP from the webpage.

Should move this info into the project to its own directory.
